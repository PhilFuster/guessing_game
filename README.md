# guessing_game
## Description
Simple guessing game developed using:
* Javascript
* Node
* MongoDB
* ejs

The purpose of this project is to review the fundamentals of Web Development.
The project idea/shell came from the Web Development class I took at 
Ramapo College of New Jersey some years ago.

Thank you Professor Frees for your tutelage.

This project has already gone through refactoring and will continue to be refactored
as more concepts are learned.

This web development refresher began with a Node server using the built in modules like
http, url, fs, and path.
Based on the file extension, the application served the appropriate mime type,
finds the file at the path requested and pipes it to the Response object.

As concepts were introduced the Node Application grew in complexity.
HTML/CSS, Forms processing, Templating, jQuery, sessions/cookies, SPA, AJAX, Mongo.

When enough concepts compunded, the Guessing Game came to life.

I have been working on this project by reading the lecture slides on a topic (Ex. jQuery).
Towards the end of the topic there is usually an excercise denoting how the Guessing Game
is to be enhanced using this new technology/concept.

Before reviewing the Professor's code I attempt to implement it my own way.
This has served me well as usually the way I went about solving the problem was different
from his and I was able to learn something from it.

Upon creation of this README **04/02/2020**, Guessing Game is built with jQuery, Node, MongoDB,
Async/Await for asynchronous programming.

The course material I was reviewing was a little dated so I updated how Guessing Game
was using these packages/libraries.
For example, MongoDB, BodyParser, and Session all worked differently now from how it did
when the course material was written. This gave me a chance to study up on the new
implenetations for these libraries and become acquainted with their Documentation.

At this point the Guessing Game looks significantly different from how it was implemented
in the class and I am proud of that.

There will be more improvements and technologies being added to this project as
time goes on.
Next up **Express**.

Cheers,
Philip
